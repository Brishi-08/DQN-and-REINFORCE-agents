The investigation of DQN and REINFORCE agents within the CartPole
environment has been extremely illuminating, revealing the deep dynamics of
reinforcement learning. As we near the end of this study, it is critical that we reflect
on our findings, understand their significance, and anticipate potential future
directions. Our experimental approach provided in-depth insights into agent learning
behaviors, revealing both their strengths and limitations. To improve future studies,
we can delve into different neural network topologies, hyperparameter tuning, and
reward-shaping methodologies. Moving into more complicated situations and using
transfer learning approaches promises a more comprehensive understanding of these
systems' capabilities. In combination with previous research, our findings share
similarities while exposing distinct characteristics of agent behaviour. The
requirement for extensive training for DQN fits with established trends, and
REINFORCE's adaptive yet fluctuating performance backs up observations from
numerous circumstances. After revising our research objectives, we efficiently
assessed the performance of DQN and REINFORCE agents in the CartPole setting.
Our findings highlight DQN's consistent growth with extended training, whereas
REINFORCE excelled at adapting in smaller increments but struggled to maintain
optimal methods. This study adds to the landscape of reinforcement learning by
providing significant insights for as well as practitioners. It reveals the paths to
improving agent performance and applications.
